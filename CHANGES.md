# Changes: Removal of Trending Topics Functionality

## Overview

We have removed the trending topics functionality from the research flow to simplify the user experience and focus on the core research capabilities. This document summarizes the changes made.

## Detailed Changes

### Research Flow

1. **Research Process Simplification**
   - Removed the trending topics option from the research method selection
   - Simplified the research flow to only use Perplexity for research generation
   - Updated the UI to remove the trending topics display from steps 2 and 3

2. **State Management**
   - Kept the state variables `trendingResult` and `selectedTopics` as empty placeholders to avoid breaking references
   - Added a constant `TRENDING_FEATURE_ENABLED = false` to indicate the feature is disabled
   - Updated supporting functions to work without trending topics

3. **UI Updates**
   - Redesigned step 1 (Research Setup) to focus on the essential content details
   - Redesigned step 2 (Research Generation) to only show Perplexity research generation
   - Redesigned step 3 (Research Results) to display research without trending topics

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Updated the Claude API's `buildPrompt` function to work well without trending topics
   - Enhanced the Perplexity API's `buildResearchPrompt` function to provide comprehensive guidance

5. **Session Storage**
   - Updated the `proceedToContentCreation` function to store an empty array for trending topics
   - Updated the structure of the `ResearchResults` interface to retain compatibility

## Affected Files

1. `src/app/create/research/page.tsx`
   - Updated research flow and UI components
   - Modified state management and helper functions

2. `src/app/api/claude/research/route.ts`
   - Enhanced the `buildPrompt` function to work well without trending topics

3. `src/app/api/perplexity/research/route.ts`
   - Enhanced the `buildResearchPrompt` function to provide better research guidance

4. `README.md`
   - Updated documentation to reflect the simplified research flow

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience**
   - More straightforward research flow with fewer decisions
   - Clearer progression through the research steps

2. **Focused Research**
   - Research results are more focused on the core topic
   - Less distraction from potentially unrelated trending topics

3. **Improved Performance**
   - Fewer API calls required for research generation
   - Faster completion of the research process

4. **Maintenance Benefits**
   - Simpler codebase with fewer dependencies
   - Easier to maintain and update in the future
