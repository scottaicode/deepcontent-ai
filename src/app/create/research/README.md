# Research Flow Improvements

## Flow Changes
We've improved the research flow by removing a redundant step:

1. **Before**: Users had to review their input on the Research Setup page and click "Start Research" to proceed to the Follow Up Questions.
2. **After**: Users are automatically taken to the Follow Up Questions once they arrive at the research page.

## Technical Implementation
- Modified the initialization code in `page.tsx` to automatically:
  - Set the research step to 2 (Follow Up Questions)
  - Generate follow-up questions based on the provided content details
  - Skip the confirmation/review step entirely

## Benefits
- Reduces friction in the research workflow
- Eliminates a redundant step where users were confirming information they already provided
- Maintains all existing functionality without data loss
- Preserves the YouTube transcript feature that's now available on the first page

## Data Flow
- Content details are still passed correctly from the initial page to Follow Up Questions
- YouTube transcript data (if provided) is preserved throughout the process
- All subsequent research generation functionality remains intact

## Future Improvements
Consider these potential enhancements:
- Further streamlining the Follow Up Questions to Deep Research transition
- Adding progress indicators between the Content Setup and Research pages
- Providing a clear way to edit initial inputs if needed without going back
