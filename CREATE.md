# Create Route Documentation

This file serves as documentation for the `/create` route in the DeepContent AI application.

## Route Purpose

The `/create` route allows users to create new content using the AI-powered content generation features.

## Implementation Details

This route is implemented using the Pages Router approach with a file at `src/pages/create.js`.

There is also a static HTML fallback at `public/create/index.html` to ensure the route is always accessible.

## Route Structure

- `/create` - Main content creation page
- `/create/:subpath` - Various subpaths for specific content creation features

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing 404 errors on this route:

1. Check that the Pages Router is enabled (experimental.appDir: false in next.config.mjs)
2. Verify that src/pages/create.js exists and is exported properly
3. Try accessing the static fallback at create/index.html
