Known Build Issues:
1. ESLint warnings about React useEffect dependencies in various files
2. Unescaped entities in some files (react/no-unescaped-entities)
3. Missing alt attributes on some img tags
4. Recommendations to use next/image instead of img tags
Note: These issues don't affect functionality but should be addressed for code quality.
