# DeepContent Website Analysis Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the website analysis feature in DeepContent, with specific optimizations for Vercel deployment.

## Overview

The website analysis feature allows users to extract content from websites to enhance their research. It uses Playwright for web scraping, which required special handling for Vercel's serverless environment.

## Key Changes

### 1. Browser Launcher Implementation

Created `src/lib/scraping/browserLauncher.ts`:
- Cross-platform browser launcher that works in both Vercel and local environments
- Properly typed interfaces for Browser and BrowserPage
- Error handling optimized for serverless environments
- Environment detection to apply different settings based on where the code runs

### 2. API Endpoint Implementation

Updated `src/app/api/scrape-website/route.ts`:
- Implemented an efficient web scraping API endpoint
- Added optimizations for Vercel's serverless environment:
  - Reduced page limits (3 pages max on Vercel vs. 8 locally)
  - Shorter timeouts (15s on Vercel vs. 30s locally)
  - Graceful fallbacks when scraping fails
  - Better error handling and recovery
  - Minimal content fallbacks when full scraping fails

### 3. UI Component Enhancements

Enhanced `src/app/components/WebsiteAnalysis.tsx`:
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic retries with simpler scraping when initial attempts fail
- Improved user feedback during analysis
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Informative display of extracted website content

### 4. Vercel-Specific Configurations

Added Vercel-specific configurations:
- Updated `vercel.json` with:
  - Memory allocation (1024MB)
  - Extended function timeouts (60s)
  - CORS configuration
  - Build commands
- Updated `package.json` to install Playwright browsers during build
- Created `.env.local.example` for required environment variables

### 5. Deployment Documentation

Created detailed documentation:
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step Vercel deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Explanation of local vs. production differences

## Environment-Specific Optimizations

The implementation includes several optimizations specifically for Vercel:

1. **Detection Logic**: Uses `process.env.VERCEL === '1'` to detect environment
2. **Reduced Scope**: Limits pages scraped, link depth, and execution time in Vercel
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple fallback strategies when full scraping fails
4. **Resource Management**: Careful handling of memory and execution time
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when errors occur

## Testing

The implementation has been tested in:
- Local development environment
- Vercel serverless functions

## Dependencies

- Playwright 1.39.0 (exact version specified)
- Chromium browser (installed during build)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Caching layer for scraped content
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- More advanced content extraction for specific site types
- Content analysis integration with AI for better insights
